'''**************Concatenating strings***********'''
# b = 'ashu'
# print(type(b))
# c = "ashu's"
# print(type(c))
# a = '''ashu''' 
# print(type(a))
# print(a,b,c)
# greeting = "Good morning, "
# name = "Ashu."

'''String slicing'''
name = "ashuu"
# print(name[1])     # name[2] = "a" ---> this cant be done

# print(name[1:4])   # <--- string slicing  in [a:b] "a" is included and "b" is excluded
print(name[1:])      # <--- prints from 2nd letter till the end (excludes 1st letter)
print(name[:4])      # <--- automatically takes 1st letter and prints till you want (includes last letter)
